## Description

_This application takes a personâ€™s age in Earth years and creates a class that returns their age in Mercury years, Venus years, Mars years, and Jupiter years. This application also determines how many years a user has left to live on each planet, and if a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, returns the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy._
